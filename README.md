This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features. Key aspects include:

Data preprocessing: handling missing values, feature engineering (e.g., calculating car age).
Encoding categorical variables (Fuel Type, Selling Type, Transmission).
Outlier detection and removal to improve model performance.
Model training using machine learning algorithms (likely Regression or Decision Trees).
Visualization of data distribution and price trends.
